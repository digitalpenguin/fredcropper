FredCropper is a plugin for the Fred (Front-end Editor) extra, which runs on MODX CMS.

ALPHA
FredCropper is currently in an alpha state and is not recommended for a production environment.
It is currently the minimum viable product.

FEATURES
- Modal editor window allowing easy cropping, rotating, flipping, zooming and resizing of multiple images.
- Works with Fred's implementation of the elFinder file browser.
- Provides previews of crops in both a preview modal window, as well as a new tab in the browser.
- Crops are all saved to a user-specified directory on the server and indexed in a custom database table.
- Information window (icon is top right next to close button). This opens a modal with any information the developer wants the editor to see for this modal. Helpful for adding instructions for different crop sizes.

PLANNED EXTRA FEATURES
- Display live image data (width, height, position etc.) while cropping.
- Swap out the source image for a single or many crops. This will allow you to have different images for different screen sizes if desired.
  Currently all crops within the same Fred element come from the same source image.
- Have a modal with fields for the user to add content for the alt and title tags.
